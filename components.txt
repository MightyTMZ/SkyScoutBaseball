detection model --> TensorFlow (since it can operate as TensorFlow.js and offline)
{
    every defensive player, 
    every possible offensive player (e.g. r1, r2, r3, batter),  
    the ball, 
    field zones (e.g. outfield, infield, pitcher's mound, base paths), 
    actions and events (base hit, walk, stolen base, pick off, etc), 
    game context (e.g. balls and strikes, score, outs, base occupancy), 
    game constraints (e.g. outfield boundaries, fair/foul balls)
}

for the batter, you must have player profiles to keep track of the practice/simulation

** generative AI to consolidate the data and provide feedback to the player

MVP steps:

- collect drone footage of baseball field
- 

** disclaimer: SkyScout Baseball does not focus on the techniquee of a player (e.g. running, throwing, catching, batting), it simply analyzes the positioning of a defensive team
